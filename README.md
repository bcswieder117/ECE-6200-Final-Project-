# ECE 6200: Final Project

**Course Description**: State space analysis of multiple-input/multiple-output continuous and discrete-time systems; linear spaces; time-varying systems, controllability, observability, and stability.

This will be a project of some sort dealing with rockets and/or satellites. The goal is to discuss the physical setup, system parameters, design criteria, and system equations. Will have a presentation and a short IEEE-styled paper. This is also 25% of my course average.
